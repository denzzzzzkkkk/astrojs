# Blog Post 1: The Future of AI: Beyond Siri and Chess

## Introduction
In a recent podcast interview, Dr. Roger Schank, a prominent figure in artificial intelligence (AI) with a PhD from Stanford, shared his insights on the future of AI and its potential to revolutionize decision-making. Unlike the current AI systems that focus on tasks like playing chess or voice recognition, Dr. Schank envisions a more advanced form of AI that can genuinely understand and assist humans in their daily lives.

## Key Takeaways from Dr. Schank's Insights

### 1. **The Misconception of AI**
- **Chess as a Benchmark**: The early AI community mistakenly believed that if computers could play chess, they could be considered intelligent. Dr. Schank argues that this narrow definition has led to widespread confusion about what AI truly is.
- **Lack of Understanding**: Even prominent figures like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking may not fully grasp the complexities of AI, leading to oversimplified statements about its capabilities.

### 2. **The Importance of Natural Language Processing**
- **Communication is Key**: Dr. Schank emphasizes that the ability to communicate effectively is a hallmark of intelligence. Current AI systems, including chatbots, often fail to engage in meaningful conversations.
- **The Challenge of Understanding**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains a significant hurdle in AI development. Dr. Schank believes that true AI must be able to understand context and engage in intelligent dialogue.

### 3. **The Vision for Future AI**
- **Intelligent Decision-Making**: Dr. Schank is working on a project called "Experts Telling Relevant Advice," which aims to provide timely and relevant advice to users based on their specific situations.
- **Learning and Memory**: For AI to be genuinely intelligent, it must learn from interactions and adapt over time, much like humans do.

## Conclusion
Dr. Roger Schank's vision for the future of AI goes beyond the current capabilities of systems like Siri and Google Search. By focusing on natural language processing and the ability to learn from experiences, we can create AI that genuinely assists and enhances human decision-making. As we move forward, it is crucial to redefine our understanding of AI and its potential impact on our lives.
